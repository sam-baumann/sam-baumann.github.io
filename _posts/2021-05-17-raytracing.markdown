I built a raytracer from scratch in python

![final product][topimage]

This is a project I worked on for a few days over christmas break. This post won't serve as a tutorial for this kind of thing, plenty of people have already done that [far better than I could][tutorial].

![initial setup][im01]

![adding a light source][im02]

![ambient component][im03]

![diffuse component][im04]

![specular component][im05]

![adding reflections][im06]

![attempting to add planes][im08]

[Find the github repo here][repo].
